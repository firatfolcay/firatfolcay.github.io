I am a 4th grade computer science student at Turkish-German University. I like
programming and I am interested in cybersecurity. I try to participate in CTFs in and
outside my country to gain experience and solve them. During my internship, I worked on
networks and ERP development in IT. Nowadays, I am focusing more on the concept of
machine learning and deep neural networks in my thesis. I have tried to look into all
aspects of computer science to decide which side of the career spectrum I want to pursue
further. I finally decide to pursue a IT career. In this Website I will post about interesting stuff
I found online(Machine learning, Cybersecurity, Networking etc.).
